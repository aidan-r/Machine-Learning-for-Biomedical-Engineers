Depicted is the solution for the final project in the machine learning for biomedical engineers course. 
The objective of the assignment was to create a pipeline for classification of metastatic lymph tissue 
from the patch_camelyon dataset published in Bejnordi et. al, 2017. The dataset can be accessed through 
the supplemental materials link listed in the publication.
